# Guide to Presentation by Video

## Description

Previously, students were required to make a poster and a short video about their project, and present the project on the exhibition that the department of MEE held each semester. But this semester, due to the special circumstance we hope you can do better at your video besides your poster. We regard this video as the real presentation you given in front of some audience and hope you can show off your team members and highlight your project features.

This is a guide about the presentation of the video.

## Requirements

Your video should follow these requirements:

1. Shortly to introduce your team. (We want others to know about your team)

2. State your project objective.  (Good examples at [examples](# Examples) #5, #6, #7 below)

   may include but not limited to:

   - What your project is.
   - The reason why you want to make this project.
   - What your project does.
   - ...

4. A short recording of your modeling process (**not necessary**).
5. Explosive animation, motion animation and/or rendering animation to demonstrate your project, with interpretation by a narrator or in text shown in the video.  (Good examples at [examples](# Examples) #1, #2，#3，#4 below)
6. Conclusion, and future improvement **if possible**.
7. Your video should be around 2 minutes long (2 minutes $\pm$ 10 seconds).
